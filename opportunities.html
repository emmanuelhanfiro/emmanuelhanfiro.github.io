Bionic organs also work to improve the lives of patients who possess artificial body parts on a day to day basis. Examples of bionic organs include: limbs, heart and brain to name some of the major ones. [1]​
​
<br><br>One example of the application of a bionic organ being the use of bionic prostheses to improve work life for people with a prosthetic limb through the improved function and ability of the prosthesis. By having the prosthetic limb feel indistinguishable from a real limb people would be able to continue working at their jobs just like before without needing to change anything. For example, a systems programmer who continuously uses his hands to type needs to have one of his arms amputated and replaced with a prosthesis. With a regular prosthesis having him continue to resume his work normally would prove to be difficult due to lack of mobility, feeling and control over his new limb. However, with a bionic prosthetic limb, he would be able to recreate the same movements that he would with a real limb with little to no issue and in a much quicker time frame. [2]​
​
<br><br>Another example being a bionic heart. Bionic hearts are mechanical hearts that are implemented in the case of certain parts or the entirety of a patient's heart being unable to function properly. By using a bionic heart a patient is given a way to survive a disability that would normally result in death without even being given another option. The mechanical heart is able to then able to simulate the pumping of blood within a person and allow them to continue to live, while perhaps not in the same way as before but live regardless, something that would not have possible without the making of artificial organs. These examples show how the making and implementation of artificial organs is able to improve the lives of people everywhere.[1]</font>
