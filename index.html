<h1 style="color: white">Project proposal</h1>
<p style= "color: white"> As technology continues to improve at a rapid pace, we are beginning to see more and more of its possible applications in the health care and medicine fields. Specifically, great advances have been made in the field of prostheses, a field which focuses on creating replacements for body parts which are no longer able to perform their needed functions.
    Prostheses are now beginning to incorporate elements of robotics, bionics, artificial intelligence, and other sophisticated technologies, allowing prostheses to deliver a much greater user experience.</p>
    <p style= "color: white">Lipetz (2021) defines bionics as "Bionics concerns artificial and bioartificial solutions that closely interact with human tissues and organs to restore lost function". Currently, much effort is being put into the development of bionic organs, with the three main approaches being artificial organs, bio-artificial organs, and organ implants.
    Globally in 2021, there were 144,302 organ transplants, which was an 11.3% increase over 2020 (https://www.transplant-observatory.org/), with thousands more still on waiting lists.  Further advancement in bionic organs could allow hundreds of thousands of people across the globe to drastically improve their bodily health.</p>
    <p style= "color: white">"Much of the promise of prosthetics and bionics rests on what is possible with AI (Lipetz, 2021)." The signals the brain sends to the body are very complicated, and up until now, processing and handling that data has been difficult. Now with AI advancing, more and more complex bodily functions can be replicated.
    An ethical concern with bionic prostheses is income inequality, they are still very expensive. Advancement of the technology may just end up providing upper class people with a higher quality of life, while poor people must settle for lower quality prostheses, or nothing at all. Another problem is that bionic prostheses are still experiencing high levels of prosthesis rejection. We will be exploring these concerns in the paper.</p>
