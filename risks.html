<p style= "color: white"> With all the benefits brought forth by artificial organs, there is still a host of risks and challenges they must first overcome for humanity to fully benefit from them. These challenges are at both the technological level, and the wider societal level.​</p>
<p style= "color: white"> "Bioartificial liver systems bear the highest potential for clinical application, even if their use is raising several controversial issues. These latter regard the identification and stratification of patients fit for transplantation, timing and type of transplantation after recovery, appropriateness of double‐‐blind, randomized clinical trials and safety of animal and//or human cell lines"(Famulari, et al., 2017).​</p>
<p style= "color: white"> At the technological level, many artificial organ technologies are dealing with risks of safety. These are completely new biological and mechanical processes being used, and with it comes the risk of long-term side effects. One example being bioartificial liver systems. These are artificial livers which use cells from pigs to replicate some of the functions of the liver, the problem being the use of animal cells means possible transmission of animal diseases such as "porcine endogenous retrovirus". A decision will have to be made on whether we wait for long term clinical trials or not.​</p>
<p style= "color: white"> On the societal level, a clear risk of artificial organs is the social stratification of society. Vermeulen et al. (2009) says "3D bioprinting is another solution that will not be a game-changer for everyone and certainly not for most in its immediate applications". Those likely to benefit the most from this  are the wealthiest members of society. A wealthy person will be able to pay for the highest and most advanced tiers of artificial organs, allowing them to benefit from greater personalization, higher standards of safety, improved function, etc. On the other hand, someone of lower socioeconomic status may have to settle for a second-hand artificial organ, or a traditional organ transplant, for which they'll have to take drugs for the rest of their lives to prevent organ rejection.</p>
